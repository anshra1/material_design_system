Widget Folder Structure:

To keep our UI components organized and easy to find, we follow a clear folder structure within `lib/src/widgets/`.
Each subfolder groups related widgets, making it intuitive to navigate and understand where to create or locate specific UI elements.

```
lib/
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ widgets/
        â”œâ”€â”€ buttons/          // Buttons (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, etc.)
        â”œâ”€â”€ cards/            // Card components
        â”œâ”€â”€ forms/            // Form input fields
        â””â”€â”€ common/           // General-purpose widgets used across the app
```

### PrimaryButton
**Purpose:** Your go-to for the most important actions.
**When To Use:** Use this when you need users to take a primary action, like 'Save Changes,' 'Submit Order,' or 'Continue to Payment.'
**Location:** `lib/src/widgets/buttons/primary_button.dart`

### SecondaryButton
**Purpose:** For actions that are important, but not the absolute primary focus.
**When To Use:** Great for giving users alternative options like 'Cancel,' 'Go Back,' or 'Skip for Now.'
**Location:** `lib/src/widgets/buttons/secondary_button.dart`

### TertiaryButton
**Purpose:** Perfect for less critical actions, often appearing as simple text links.
**When To Use:** Use when the action is supplementary, like 'Learn More,' 'View Details,' or 'Retry.' (Currently, this widget is a placeholder and needs to be created.)
**Location:** // TODO: Find or create TertiaryButton
